A program to implement the Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm (m-estimate version) for a binary classification problem. The program takes two inputs: a training dataset and a test dataset. The value of m is the number of possible values of a feature. It calculates all required probabilities, and then predicts the class of each instance in the test set. The program also cpmputes the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.
